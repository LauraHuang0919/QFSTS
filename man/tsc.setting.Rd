\usage{
tsc.setting(
  Ytrain,
  mu = NULL,
  rho = NULL,
  S = NULL,
  vrho = NULL,
  lambda = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ytrain}{The multivariate time series to be modeled.}

\item{mu}{A vector of logic values indicating whether to include a local trend for each target series.}

\item{rho}{A vector of numerical values taking values in [0, 1], describing the learning rates at which the local trend is updated for each target series. The value 0 in the j-th entry indicates that the j-th target series does not include slope of trend.}

\item{S}{A vector of integer values representing the number of seasons to be modeled for each target series. The value 0 in the j-th entry indicates that the j-th target series does not include the seasonal component.}

\item{vrho}{A vector of numerical values taking values in [0, 1], describing a damping factor for each target series. The value 0 in the j-th entry indicates that the j-th target series does not include the cycle component.}

\item{lambda}{A vector of numerical values, whose entries equal to 2π/q with q being a period such that 0 < λ < π, describing the frequency.}
